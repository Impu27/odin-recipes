    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Broccoli Cauliflower Casserole is a comforting and hearty
        dish that combines two nutritious vegetables—broccoli and
        cauliflower—into a creamy, baked casserole. The vegetables 
        are typically blanched or steamed to tenderize them before 
        being mixed with a creamy sauce made from ingredients like 
        cream cheese, sour cream, or a creamy soup base. Cheddar cheese,
        garlic, and seasonings are often added to enhance flavor. The 
        casserole is then topped with a layer of shredded cheese or breadcrumbs
        for a crispy, golden finish. It is a popular side dish for holidays or 
        family dinners, offering a rich and savory way to enjoy vegetables while
        adding a satisfying texture contrast.</p>
