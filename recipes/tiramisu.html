    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tiramisu is a classic Italian dessert known for its creamy,
        rich, and indulgent flavor. It consists of layers of coffee-soaked
        ladyfinger biscuits (savoiardi) and a luscious mascarpone cheese mixture,
        often flavored with cocoa powder and sometimes a hint of liqueur like 
        Marsala or rum. The dessert is typically chilled to allow the flavors to
         meld together, creating a soft and velvety texture.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ladyfinger biscuits - 250g</li>
        <li>Espresso coffee - 350ml</li>
        <li>Marsala wine - 3tbsp</li>
        <li>Mascarpone cheese - 500g</li>
        <li>Egg yolks - 4 large</li>
        <li>Granulated sugar - 100g</li>
        <li>Heavy cream - 120ml</li>
        <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder - 2 tbsp</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Coffee Base: Brew espresso, let it cool, and mix with optional liqueur (Marsala, rum, or coffee liqueur).</li>
        <li>Make the Cream Mixture: Whisk egg yolks and sugar until pale and creamy. Add mascarpone cheese and mix until smooth. If using, gently fold in whipped cream for a lighter texture.</li>
        <li>Assemble the Layers: Quickly dip ladyfingers into the coffee mixture (do not soak too long to avoid sogginess). Arrange a layer of dipped ladyfingers in a dish.</li>
        <li>Add Cream: Spread half of the mascarpone mixture evenly over the ladyfingers.</li>
        <li>Repeat Layers: Add another layer of coffee-dipped ladyfingers and top with the remaining mascarpone mixture.</li>
        <li>Dust and Chill: Dust the top with cocoa powder and refrigerate for at least 4 to 6 hours (or overnight) to allow flavors to meld.</li>
    </ol>
