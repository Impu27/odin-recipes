    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish known for its rich, comforting layers 
        of pasta, sauce, cheese, and often meat. Typically made with wide, flat
        sheets of pasta, the dish alternates between layers of marinara sauce, 
        a creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese mixture, and a meat filling, such as 
        ground beef or sausage, although vegetarian variations can use spinach or 
        other vegetables. Once assembled, the lasagna is baked until golden and 
        bubbly, with the flavors melding together into a savory and satisfying meal.
        It's a versatile dish, allowing for many variations depending on regional 
        preferences or personal tastes, but it remains a beloved comfort food worldwide.</p>
